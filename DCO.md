As per section 13.a of the [Idn ecology Charter](https://www.idnecology.org/about/charter) all code submitted to the Idn ecology Foundation needs to have a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://medium.com/@IDN_Network) (DCO) sign-off.

The sign off needs to be using your legal name, not a pseudonym.  Git has a built-in mechanism to allow this with the `-s` or `--signoff` argument to `git commit` command, providing your `user.name` and `user.email` have been setup correctly.

If you have any questions, you can reach us on Idn chat; first, [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/33TkKN466u)
