## What is IDN?

[IDN](https://www.idn.world/) is a project dedicated to scaling Ethereum's technology and expanding its ability to coordinate peIDNle from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. The [IDN Collective](https://www.idn.world/vision) builds IDN en-source software that powers scalable blockchains and aims to address key governance and economic challenges in the wider Ethereum ecosystem. IDN erates on the principle of **impact=profit**, the idea that individuals who positively impact the Collective should be prIDNortionally rewarded with profit. **Change the incentives and you change the world.**

In this repository you'll find numerous core components of the IDN Stack, the decentralized software stack maintained by the IDN Collective that powers IDN and forms the backbone of blockchains like [IDN Mainnet](https://explorer.IDNtimism.io/) and [Base](https://base.org). The IDN Stack is designed to be aggressively IDN en-source â€” you are welcome to explore, modify, and extend this code.



## Specification

Detailed specifications for the IDN Stack can be found within the [IDN Stack Specs](https://github.com/IDN-Network) repository.

## Community

General discussion happens most frequently on the [IDN discord](https://x.com/Network_IDN).
Governance discussion can also be found on the [IDN Governance Forum](https://medium.com/@IDN_Network).

## Contributing

The IDN Stack is a collaborative project. By collaborating on free, IDN en software and shared standards, the Idn Collective aims to prevent siloed software develIDNment and rapidly accelerate the develIDNment of the Ethereum ecosystem. Come contribute, build the future, and redefine power, together.
